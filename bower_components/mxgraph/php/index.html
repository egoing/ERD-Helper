<h1>mxGraph PHP</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
	The following assumes that an Apache server or another server capable of
	running PHP 5 is running on the default port (80) on localhost. The
	mxGraph top-level directory is assumed to be located at
	<a href="http://localhost/mxgraph">http://localhost/mxgraph</a>.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Graph</h3>
<p>
	In this example, a graph is programmatically created and turned into a PNG
	image. Point your browser to
	<a href="http://localhost/mxgraph/php/examples/graph.php">http://localhost/mxgraph/php/examples/graph.php</a>
	to run this example.
</p>
<h3>Reader</h3>
<p>
	Creates a HTML graphical representation for a GraphView which is stored in
	an XML file. Point your browser to 
	<a href="http://localhost/mxgraph/php/examples/reader.php">http://localhost/mxgraph/php/examples/reader.php</a>
	to run this example.
</p>
<h3>Server</h3>
<p>
	In order to be able to save files, the server.php file demonstrates how to
	accept a post request from a client, and put the data from the client
	request into a file on the disk.
</p>
<p>
	Before accessing the HTML files, you must modify the config file of the
	example you want to use. For example, when using the diagrameditor.html
	file, you should modify javascript/examples/editors/config/diagrameditor.xml.
	The only change to the config file is to add the urlPost attribute to the
	mxEditor node as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;mxEditor urlPost="php/examples/server.php" ... &gt;
</pre>
<p>
	This enables the save function in the editor and will post the XML of the
	current diagram to the server.php on the server. The script will write the
	diagram to a local file called diagram.xml in the same directory as the
	script is located.
</p>
<p>
	Note that you will have to add the save action in the user interface. To
	add the save action to the dropdown list of actions, change the items in
	the diagrameditor.html file as follows:
</p>
<pre>
var items = ['redo', 'ungroup', 'cut', 'copy', 'paste', 'show', 'exportImage', 'save'];
</pre>
<p>
	To use the example, point your browser to
	<a href="http://localhost/mxgraph/javascript/examples/editors/diagrameditor.html">http://localhost/mxgraph/javascript/examples/editors/diagrameditor.html</a>
