Document: API Specification

Overview:

  This PHP library is divided into 4 packages. The top-level <mxServer>
  class dynamically includes everything else.
  
  The *view* and *model* packages implement the graph component, represented
  by <mxGraph>. It refers to a <mxGraphModel> which contains <mxCell>s and
  caches the state of the cells in a <mxGraphView>. The cells are painted
  using a <mxCanvas> based on the appearance defined in <mxStylesheet>.

  The *io* package implements a generic <mxObjectCodec> for turning
  PHP objects into XML. The main class is <mxCodec>. <mxCodecRegistry>
  is the global registry for custom codecs.

Requirements:

  The I/O module requires libxml support. The <mxGdCanvas> requires GD support.
